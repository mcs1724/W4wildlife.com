<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Clouded leopards are two species of wild cat that live throughout the forests of Southeast Asia. ... The cats on mainland Asia and Taiwan kept the traditional species name (Neofelis nebulosa) while the cats from Borneo and Sumatra took the name the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi).They are from the felidae family and pure carnivores.They are also solitary creatures like leopards,Jaguars and Tigers.</p>
<h1>Physical Description </h1>
<p>Due to its forest habitat, clouded leopards have large, dexterous paws with specialized footpads for gripping branches. Specialized anklebones allow varied position for climbing, including climbing headfirst down trees. Another distinctive feature of the clouded leopard is its long canine teeth. These canines are longer in proportion to skull size than those of any other species of wild cat.

While more closely related to big cats, the clouded leopard is frequently described as bridging the gap between big and small cats due largely to its smaller stature. It has proportionately short legs and a long tail. The coat is brown or yellowish-gray and covered with irregular dark stripes, spots and blotches. Black and pale, whitish individuals have been reported from Borneo indicating the species may exhibit dark and albino forms.

While all species of cats are classified as one family, the Felidae, genetic research has shown the clouded leopard to be most closely related to the large cat species. Clouded leopards are not a "type" of leopard as their name implies. They are a separate species of wild cat, as are snow leopards and leopards. Recent research has proposed the clouded leopard branched from other members of the Pantherinae family first—over 6 million years ago—making them the most ancient feline species in the modern cat world.

<h2> Size </h2>
<p>Males weigh up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms). Females are significantly smaller, usually 25 to 35 pounds (11 to 21 kilograms).</p>
<h1> Habitat </h1>
<p>Clouded leopards dwell in the cloud forests of Southeast Asia and are one of the most ancient cat species>They can be found in the following countries-Southern China,Northeast India,Bhutan,Burma,Nepal,Thailand,Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, and Bangladesh. It is believed to be extinct in Taiwan, China.
<h2>Population </h2>
<p>  It is estimated that fewer than 10,000 mature individuals remain in the wild </p>
<h1> Are Clouded Leopards Endangered? </h1>
<p>Their conversation status is vunerable (population decreasing).They are crictically endangered.</p>
<h3>Why is the clouded leopard endangered?</h3>
<p>Clouded leopards are victims of habitat destruction and illegal poaching. Their forest habitat is experiencing the world's fastest rate of deforestation. Clear cutting of forests for use as agricultural lands such as palm oil, is its primary threat, as the clouded leopard requires large tracts of forest for hunting.</p>
<h1> Communication </h1>
<p>Due to a different bone structure in their neck, the clouded leopard cannot roar like the larger cats, but also cannot purr because it lacks the fully ossified hyoid bone that allows small cats this ability. Vocalizations include growling, hissing and chuffing.</p>
<h4>Sleep Habits </h4>
<p>Clouded leopards are thought to be primarily nocturnal</p>
<h1> Lifespan </h1>
<p>The average life span of the clouded leopard is 12 to 15 years, though they may live up to 17 years in human care.</p>
<h1>Food/Eating Habits </h1>
<p>Like all wild cats, clouded leopards are carnivores. Their chief prey are gibbons, macaques, slow loris, small deer and wild boars, which they ambush from the trees or stalk from the ground. They may also hunt birds and rodents. Scientists once thought that clouded leopards mainly hunted from or in trees; current thought, however, is that while some hunting may occur in the trees, the majority most likely takes place on the ground. Although a relatively small predator, a clouded leopard can take down sizeable prey because of its strong legs, large canines and extreme gape (ability to open mouth to about 100 degrees).</p>
